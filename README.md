# SalesInsights_DataAnalysis_Visualization
The dataset contains all information related to the sales such as products, customers, markets, transactions.
I ingested this data in MySQL database and performed basic data cleaning processes and then hooked it up with Tableau Desktop for visualization.
Then I prepared some automated dashboards which gave a deep insight into the company's business.

**Aim is to check whether the sales team is able to meet the target or not in different regions and also do some profit analysis.**

## Queries for cleaning data:

select * from sales.transactions;

select * from sales.transactions where currency = "USD";

update sales.transactions set sales_amount = sales_amount*74, currency = "INR" where currency = "USD";

update sales.transactions set sales_amount = 1 where sales_amount<0;

select * from sales.transactions where market_code = "Mark 097" or market_code = "Mark 999";

select * from sales.markets where zone = "";

delete from sales.markets where zone = "";

alter table sales.transactions rename column profit_margin to profit;

alter table sales.transactions rename column profit_margin_percentage to profit_margin;

## Analysis:

a) We can see that in the year 2020, maximum revenue is being generated by Delhi NCR region but profit earned over it is very less.
(We must take some important measures to improve the profit earned, so that the company can get max. output.)

b) In Bhubaneshwar company is making a decent amount of profit but lacks in the total sales and hence the revenue earned.
(Increase in sales would definitely help a lot.)
   
c) Markets such as Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Nagpur, Bhopal are doing well where as in case of Lucknow critical thinking and actions are required.

d) We can also see which customers in which markets are doing better as compared to others.

**Below are some factors that can be looked upon or suggestions which can improve the scenario:**

1) Product Quality

2) Product Attraction (includes packaging)

3) Promotions/Advertising

4) Discounts can be given

5) Healthy communication between management and suppliers (try building a relationship)

6) Know about the areas/markets in which you are selling your products
