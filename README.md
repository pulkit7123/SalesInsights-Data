# SalesInsights-DataAnalysis
The dataset contains all information related to the sales such as products, customers, markets, transactions.
I ingested this data in MySQL database and performed basic data cleaning processes and then hooked it up with Tableau Desktop for visualization.
Then I prepared some automated dashboards which gave a deep insight into the company's business.

This dashboard highlights revenue and sales quantity breakdown yearly and on a monthly basis, also information related to customers and products.
